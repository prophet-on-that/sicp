* Debugging internal defines
  - Work out why the following isn't working:
    #+BEGIN_SRC scm
    (eval (let ((a '*undefined*)
          (b '*undefined))
      (set a b)
      (set b 1)
      (cons a b) (setup-environment)
    #+END_SRC
    Look at let->combination of this.
* Register machine
  - Introduce typed pointer representation
    - These will never be contructed directly by the assembly program,
      but will be constructed in the assembler by operations such as
      ~const~ and ~cons~.
    - Types:
      - Empty list
      - Integer
      - Pair
      - Symbol
  - Symbol handling
    - Need to intern symbols when first encountered
    - Read must also intern symbols
    - Introduce symbol table for this
  - ~read~ is a primitive provided by the machine, which should read
    from the standard input, intern symbols and create a list, leaving
    the pair in the given register argument.
  - ~print~ is an operation of the machine which will print the
    representation of whatever is in the given register.
  - Machine interface:
    - registers:
      - whatever is requested
    - memory blocks/vectors (all of fixed size):
      - stack
      - the-cars
      - the-cdrs
      - new-cars
      - new-cdrs
      Could provide ability to declare vectors and their sizes as
      parameters to the machine.
    - operations:
      - read
      - print
      - vector-ref
      - vector-set
      - max number of pairs (to trigger garbage collection)
      - arithmetic
        - +
        - *
        - -
        - /
      - symbol->string and string->symbol (require char type)
    - special forms:
      - save
      - restore
      - assign
      - perform
      - test
      - branch
      - goto
    - If we decided to not have the machine be aware of the typed
      pointer representation, ~read~ and ~print~ couldn't be
      implemented.
* Error representation
  - Representing errors as values doesn't work as they are not
    propagated e.g. ~(cons (+ 'a 1) 2)~ will not raise the
    error. Also, ~assoc~ doesn't need to return an error and can just
    return ~#f~, as is the correct Scheme behaviour.
  - In the absence of a proper exception system, propose having
    ~make-error~ jump to a configurable error handler:
    - By default, propagate as a system error
    - In the interpreter, jump back to the repl
    - In test code, jump to a custom function to verify the error has
      been raised.
    Really need to unwind the stack, however, as otherwise a whole
    bunch of memory is never reclaimed. Either that or recreate the
    stack, if possible.
